# üñ•Ô∏è TIU-UCA-T107 Computer Fundamentals and Programming in C

This repository contains all the questions and solutions (source code) of the subject TIU-UCA-T107 Computer Fundamentals and Programming in C, which is taught in the first year of the BCA Hons Course at Techno India University.

The repository consists of one folder and one text file. The folder `Solutions` contains all the C source code files, each named according to the question number. The text file contains all the questions or problem statements, also numbered accordingly.

## üßë‚Äçüíª How to use the source code

To use the source code, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. You can use any C compiler that supports the C99 standard, such as GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio. Here are some instructions on how to install and use GCC on different operating systems:

### To install gcc on Windows:

- Download MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) from https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/
- Run the installer and select gcc from the list of packages
- Add MinGW/bin to your system path
- Open a command prompt and type `gcc --version` to verify that gcc is installed

### To install gcc on Linux:

- Most Linux distributions come with gcc pre-installed. If not, you can use your package manager to install it
- For example, on Ubuntu or Debian-based systems you can use `sudo apt-get install gcc`
- On Fedora or Red Hat-based systems you can use `sudo yum install gcc`
- Open a terminal and type `gcc --version` to verify that gcc is installed

### To install gcc on Mac:

- You need to install Xcode (Apple's development environment) from https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
- Xcode comes with gcc and other tools
- Open a terminal and type `gcc --version` to verify that gcc is installed

### To compile a C program using gcc, you need to use the following command:

`gcc -o output_file input_file.c`

where output_file is the name of the executable file that will be generated and input_file.c is the name of the source code file that contains your program.

### To run a C++ program after compiling using gcc, you need to use the following command:

`./output_file`

where output_file is the name of the executable file that was generated by gcc. You may need to add `./` before output_file to indicate that it is in the current directory.
